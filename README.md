### Task

In this scenario, we are working for a metro paper in a data visualisation position and we are tasked with analysing the current trends shaping people's lives.
The dataset given is from the US Census Bureau and we will be looking at 6 different categories:
* Poverty (%)
* Age (%)
* Household Income 
* Lacks Healthcare (%)
* Smokes (%)
* Obesity (%)

Our task is to create an interactive scatterplot with click events so that users can decide which data to display. 
A d3 tool tip also needs to be incorporated to show point data upon hover.
